# Chapter 3: Kinematics

Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move.

It is often referred to as the "geometry of motion" and is a fundamental concept in physics.

## Key Formulas

Here are the key formulas for motion with constant acceleration:

1. `v = u + at`
2. `s = ut + 0.5at^2`
3. `v^2 = u^2 + 2as`

Where:
- `s` is displacement
- `u` is initial velocity
- `v` is final velocity
- `a` is acceleration
- `t` is time

## Worked Example: Dropping a Ball

**Problem:** A ball is dropped from a tower that is 70 m high. Assuming it starts from rest and acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s², how long does it take to hit the ground?

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify the knowns:**
    - Displacement `s = 70` m
    - Initial velocity `u = 0` m/s (since it's dropped from rest)
    - Acceleration `a = 9.8` m/s²

2.  **Choose the right formula:**
    We need to find time `t` and we have `s`, `u`, and `a`. The formula `s = ut + 0.5at^2` is perfect.

3.  **Solve for t:**
    `70 = (0 * t) + 0.5 * 9.8 * t^2`
    `70 = 4.9 * t^2`
    `t^2 = 70 / 4.9`
    `t^2 = 14.28`
    `t = sqrt(14.28) ≈ 3.78` seconds.

The ball takes approximately 3.78 seconds to hit the ground.
